# The Wetter

A very simple yet beautiful application to know the weather of a specific city of the world.

This was my first Flutter application, which allows me to know how much I have progressed since. I decided to try to run the application again and update the required code to support Null Safety and implement the changes of deprecated libraries/support new updates.

**The Wetter 2.0.0 now fully works on iOS (15.5) and Android (13) devices!**

## About the application

The Wetter is a weather (got it?) application where you can enter the name of the city you would like to know about. The temperature, a small description, the chances of precipitation and a beautiful background will appear on your screen.

This was the project that got me started into Flutter and I was thinking about making it breath again to support the latest Flutter, Dart and dependencies updates.

### The looks

The design of the application and its animations is an aspect of it am proud of. There is, as always, room for improvement:

### About the backend

I decided to work on The Wetter once I built a **[backend](https://github.com/srLitem/node-weather-webApp)** in Node.JS for a weather application with the help of [Andrew Mead's Node JS developers Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2). Once I Built the [web application with React.js](https://litem-weather-webapp.herokuapp.com/) for said backend, I decided to dive in the mobile world and that is when I got to know Flutter.

Working with Node.js (a technology I have not used much since) gave me the accomplishment of building something from scratch, for personal motives for the first time. 

However, working with a backend created when I was still learning the basics of Node.js created some limitations I now see. This is not a bad thing, but allows me to identify some points of improvement I will implement, maybe migrating to Firebase is a good call or touching some Node.js code to level up the challenge. I will decide in the future!

### Ideas of improvements

My main goal by modifying the code of the application was to make it runnable on the latest stable version of the OS of Android and iOS devices. 
I worked on improving more things that I expected at the beggining of this "revival process",but **there is still a lot of code to improve** on aspects like Theming, Routing, Reusable code/widgets, responsiveness, internatioalization, better Bloc implementation and more. However, here's a list of features and improvements I would like to add in the future to this simple yet beloved project:

* GeoLocation
* Widgets implementation
* Multi-city visualization.
* Multiple temperature units.

Thanks for reading and feel free to clone the app, run it and even suggest improvements and features!
